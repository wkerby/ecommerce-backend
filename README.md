# E-commerce Back End

## Description

As part of this assignment, I was tasked with taking a working Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database to complete the back-end build. I learned how to work with relational MySQL data and sharpened my skills in modular route building.

## Usage

To use this app, the user will have to run an npm start from the command line to start the server. Below you will find a demonstration video in which each of the routes that I helped create are tested successfully. GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints were created for all product, category, and tag data:

## Credits

I would like to credit the contributor Xandromus for desiging and creating the code found in the server.js file at the root of the repository and for intializing the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for product, category, and tag data that I helped complete.

## Features

- Fully-functional server routes for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP requests made on product, category, and tag data
- Relational database created with an extension on the Sequelize "Model" class
